# Rationale
There are a lot of cryprocurrencies and many of them maintain their own blockchain. Essentially, blockchain is a database, therefore you can interact with it in the same way as with the ordinary database. If you follow how the database interacting tools evolved, you can see that at low-level there are database adapters (such as psycopg2, pymongo, etc.) on top of which are built
more abstract and convenient ORMs/ODMs (sqlalchemy, mongo-engine, etc.) Blockchain technology, that is still in its infancy, really lacks similar tools for developers. The goal of this project is to become such a tool. It provides both low-level adapters and high-level ORM-like API for interacting with blockchain node. Also, it's worth clarifying, that ordinary databases have already reached stable APIs unlike blockchain nodes that just provide scattered JSON RPC or/and other non-standard API. OBM is trying to do typically things in universal way. Thereby standardization and unification become the second project goal.
