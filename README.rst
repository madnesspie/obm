Motivation
==========
There are a lot of cryprocurrencies and many of them maintain their own
blockchain. Essentially, blockchain is a database, therefore you can interact
with it in the same way as with the ordinary database. If you follow how the
database interacting tools evolved, you can see that at low-level there are
database adapters (such as psycopg2, pymongo, etc.) on top of which are built
more abstract and convenient ORMs/ODMs (sqlalchemy, mongo-engine, etc.)
Blockchain technology, that is still in its infancy, really lacks similar tools
for developers. The goal of this project is to become such a tool. It provides
both low-level adapters and high-level ORM-like API for interacting with
blockchain node. Also, it's worth clarifying, that ordinary databases have
already reached stable APIs unlike blockchain nodes that just provide scattered
JSON RPC or/and other non-standard API. OBM is trying to do typically things in
universal way. Thereby standardization and unification become the second
project goal.
